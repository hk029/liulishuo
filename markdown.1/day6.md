# day6 'I got into Yale' isn't a moral defense

## 原文

“我考上了耶鲁”不是道德辩护的依据

When Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh found his conduct in question on Thursday, he twice responded by referring to his Ivy League degrees.
当最高法院大法官提名人布雷特·卡瓦诺（Brett Kavanaugh）在周四发现他受到行为不端的指控时，他两次回答都提到了他的常春藤盟校学位。

At one point, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse pursued a line of questioning about the "Beach Week Ralph Club," a phrase that appeared in Kavanaugh's yearbook next to his senior photo. Whitehouse asked if the "Ralph Club" reference had to do specifically with alcohol, and Kavanaugh responded:
有一次，参议员谢尔登·怀特豪斯（Sheldon Whitehouse）对“沙滩周拉尔夫俱乐部”（Beach Week Ralph Club）提出一系列质询，这个短语在卡瓦诺的毕业纪念册中出现，就在他的大四照片旁边。怀特豪斯问他“拉尔夫俱乐部”的说法是否特指喝酒，卡瓦诺回答说：

"Senator, I was at the top of my class academically, busted my butt in school. Captain of the varsity basketball team. Got in Yale College. When I got into Yale College, got into Yale Law School. Worked my tail off."
“参议员，我当时是班上成绩拔尖的学生，在学校里拼命学习。还是大学篮球队的队长。我考进了耶鲁大学。进入耶鲁大学时，我考进了耶鲁法学院。我拼了命努力。”

It was a deflection, but the particular shield he raised was telling. His response seems to suggest a belief that a prestigious education stands as evidence of moral rightness.
这话是在转移话题，但他举起的这面挡箭牌却很能说明问题。他的回答似乎暗示他相信，名校出身是道德正当的证明。

Kavanaugh treated his education as a magic wand, something that could be waved to dispel questions of his conduct. Indeed, Americans have a particular fondness for meritocratic narratives, frequently conflating achievements and hard work with human worth.
卡瓦诺把自己的教育看作是一根魔杖，可以用它来驱散关于他行为的质问。的确，美国人特别喜欢精英主义的叙事，常常把成就、努力工作和个人价值混为一谈。

It should go without saying, but there are all sorts of bad actors who have attended prestigious universities. It is a reminder that attending a prestigious school isn't in and of itself revealing of anyone's moral character in any direction.
其实不用说也知道，有各种各样品行不端的人上过名牌大学。这提醒我们，出身名校本身并不能展现任何人在任何方面的道德品质。
